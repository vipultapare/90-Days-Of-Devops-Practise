# 90 Days DevOps Learning Plan – Day 01

## Current Status
I am a **working professional** with experience in software development and backend technologies. I have basic knowledge of Git, APIs, and application development, but limited hands-on experience in DevOps tools, cloud infrastructure, and automation.

---

## My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud
DevOps is a culture and practice that focuses on **automation, collaboration, and continuous delivery** to release software faster and more reliably.  
Cloud Engineering involves designing, deploying, and managing applications on cloud platforms with scalability, high availability, and cost efficiency.

---

## Why I Am Learning DevOps & Cloud
- To move from development to **end-to-end system ownership**
- To increase my **career growth and industry demand**
- To gain skills in **automation, cloud deployment, and scalable infrastructure**

---

## Where I Want to Reach (Next 90 Days Goals)
1. Deploy a full-stack application on **AWS** using CI/CD.
2. Containerize applications using **Docker** and deploy them on **Kubernetes**.
3. Build a **production-style DevOps project** with Infrastructure + CI/CD + Monitoring.

---

## Core DevOps Skills to Build
1. **Linux & Networking Troubleshooting**
2. **CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions / Jenkins)**
3. **Docker & Kubernetes Deployment and Debugging**

---

## Time Commitment
- Weekdays: **2 hours daily**
- Weekends: **4–5 hours**
- Total: ~**15–18 hours per week**

---

## How I Will Stay Consistent
- Follow a fixed daily learning schedule
- Practice hands-on instead of only watching tutorials
- Share progress on GitHub and LinkedIn (#90DaysOfDevOps)
- Focus on small daily targets instead of perfection

---

## Final Commitment
For the next 90 days, I will focus on **discipline, consistency, and execution** to transition into a DevOps role and build real-world cloud and automation skills.
